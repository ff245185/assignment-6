                Difference between var let and const</h2>

            <h5>var: - hoisted (always declared at top of scope, global if none) - function scope....

                let: - block scope - not redeclarable....

                const: - block scope - not reassignable - not redeclarable</h5>

            <h5>Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this . The value of this inside an arrow
                function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of
                this in the closest non-arrow parent function.</h5>

            <h2>Question no 03:
                Difference between var let and const</h2>
            <h4>answare:</h4>
            <h5>The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the array and executes the
                callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value. If the value is true element
                remains in the resulting array but if the return value is false the element will be removed for the
                resulting array.
                <br>
                The filter() method is used to filters all the elements and returns the element that matches and the
                element that do not match are removed. The only difference is the filter() method search through all the
                elements while find() method search through all the child elements only.

                Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older
                versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic element</h5>
